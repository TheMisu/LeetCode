# Task
Given an array of integers _nums_ and an integer _target_, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to _target_.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.


# Example:
- Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
- Output: [1, 2]

# Constraints:
- Only *ONE* valid answer exists. => No need to check if there is *NO* such sum in the array.
