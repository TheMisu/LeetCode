# About

These are my solutions to LeetCode problems.


# Structure
- The tasks are described in .md files and then implemented in Python.
- The files are named based on the following pattern: X_NUM_TITLE 
    - X = E/M/H (Easy/Medium/Hard) depending on the problem's difficulty
    - NUM = the problem's number
    - TITLE = the problem's title
